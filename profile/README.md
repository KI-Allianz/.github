# KI-Allianz Baden-Württemberg
we are devoping the AI Data Platform (KI-Datenplattform)

The **AI Data Platform** is an open, interoperable infrastructure developed by the **KI Alliance Baden-Württemberg**.  
Its goal: make **high-quality datasets**, **AI models**, and **compute resources** easily accessible to companies, researchers, and public institutions.

## 🌐 What the Platform Aims to Provide
- A **metadata-based catalog** for datasets and AI models  
- **Quality assurance tools** for data preparation and annotation  
- Seemless workflows towards **Cloud and HPC resources** for training and experimentation with data 
- Built-in **legal & ethical compliance** for safe data use  

## 💡 Why It Matters
Many organizations — especially SMEs — lack structured data, annotation tools, or legal clarity.  
The AI Data Platform removes these barriers, helping teams build trustworthy and production-ready AI solutions faster.
